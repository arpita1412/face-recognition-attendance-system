# face-recognition-attendance-system

This project is a face recognition real-time attendance system that uses a webcam to detect faces and update attendance records in a Firebase database. The system is designed to streamline the attendance process by automating the process of marking attendance, eliminating the need for manual attendance tracking.
The system uses advanced face recognition technology to identify students in real-time. Once a student's face is detected, the system automatically marks their attendance and updates the attendance record in the Firebase database. The system can also display student details, such as name and ID, alongside the attendance status.
